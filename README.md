# figs

Collected figures for the lab -- putting all the figures in one place, and making *relative* symlinks to this repository, makes it much easier and more efficient to share figures across papers / talks, etc.

Outside users are welcome to use our lab figures, with proper citation credit, and unfortunately have to deal with the copyright police (aka Journals).
